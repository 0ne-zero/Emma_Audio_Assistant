## General Information
- Let me admit that I am lazy. So I decided to make a simple voice assistant using Python.
Of course, it still can not work with voice and uses text as input.
(Honestly, I do not have a microphone)


## Technologies Used
- Python - version 3.8
- AIML   - version 1.0

## Screenshot
- Emma can tell jokes:
