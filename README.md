## General Information
- Let me admit that I am lazy. So I decided to make a simple voice assistant using Python.
Of course, it still can not work with voice and uses text as input.
(Honestly, I do not have a microphone available)


## Technologies Used
- Python - version 3.8
- AIML   - version 1.0

## Setup
Dependencies are available in [here](https://github.com/0ne-zero/Emma_Audio_Assistant/blob/main/requirements.txt)
$ git clone https://github.com/0ne-zero/Emma_Audio_Assistant
$ cd ./Emma_Audio_Assistant/
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ python3 emma_core/emma.py


## Project Status
