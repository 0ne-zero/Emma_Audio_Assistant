## General Information
- Let me admit that I am lazy. So I decided to make a simple voice assistant using Python.
In theory, it should recognize voice, But in my system, I saddly have driver issues with my microphone, so I can't test it correctly.
- For now, Emma can do just basic tasks.


## Technologies Used
- Python - version 3.8
- AIML   - version 1.0
